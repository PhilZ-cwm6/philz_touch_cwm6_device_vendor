# This file sets variables that control the way modules are built
# thorughout the system. It should not be used to conditionally
# disable makefiles (the proper mechanism to control what gets
# included in a build is to use PRODUCT_PACKAGES in a product
# definition file).

# WARNING: This line must come *before* including the proprietary
# variant, so that it gets overwritten by the parent (which goes
# against the traditional rules of inheritance).
